# State and Cache Control Hooks

## State Hooks

### useLocationState()

Read type-safe state from history:

```tsx
"use client";
import { useLocationState, createLocationState } from "@rangojs/router/client";

// Define typed state (all export patterns supported)
// Keys are auto-injected by the Vite plugin -- no manual key needed.
export const ProductState = createLocationState<{
  name: string;
  price: number;
}>();

// Also valid: const ProductState = createLocationState<...>();
//             export { ProductState };
// Also valid: export { ProductState as MyState };

function ProductHeader() {
  const state = useLocationState(ProductState);
  // { name: string; price: number } | undefined

  if (state) {
    return (
      <h1>
        {state.name} - ${state.price}
      </h1>
    );
  }
  return <h1>Loading...</h1>;
}
```

Pass state through Link:

```tsx
import { Link } from "@rangojs/router/client";
import { ProductState } from "./state";

<Link to="/product/123" state={[ProductState({ name: "Widget", price: 99 })]}>
  View Product
</Link>;
```

Pass typed state just in time (getter evaluated at click time, not render time):

```tsx
"use client"; // JIT state requires a client component (getter can't cross RSC boundary)

import { Link } from "@rangojs/router/client";
import { ProductState } from "./state";

// The getter is stored lazily and only called when the user clicks the link.
// This is useful for capturing values that change after render (e.g., scroll
// position, form state, ref values).
<Link
  to="/product/123"
  state={[ProductState(() => ({ name: product.name, price: product.price }))]}
>
  View Product
</Link>;
```

Plain state can also be evaluated just in time (also requires a client component):

```tsx
<Link to="/product/123" state={() => ({ from: window.location.pathname })}>
  View Product
</Link>
```

### Flash State (read-once)

Create a location state with `{ flash: true }` for read-once state that
auto-clears after first render. Ideal for flash messages (success/error
notifications after redirect):

```tsx
// location-states.ts
import { createLocationState } from "@rangojs/router";

export const FlashMessage = createLocationState<{ text: string }>({
  flash: true,
});
```

Read flash state with `useLocationState` (same hook as persistent state):

```tsx
"use client";
import { useLocationState } from "@rangojs/router/client";
import { FlashMessage } from "../location-states";

function FlashBanner() {
  const flash = useLocationState(FlashMessage);
  // { text: string } | undefined

  if (!flash) return null;
  return <div className="flash">{flash.text}</div>;
}
```

Flash behavior is determined by the definition (`{ flash: true }`), not by which
hook reads it. `useLocationState` reads the value synchronously during render,
then clears it from `history.state` via `replaceState` in a `useEffect`.
Multiple components reading the same flash definition all see the value.
Pressing back/forward will not re-show the flash since it was cleared.

Set flash state from the server via `redirect()` with state:

```tsx
// In a route handler
import { redirect, createLocationState } from "@rangojs/router";

export const FlashMessage = createLocationState<{ text: string }>({
  flash: true,
});

// Handler
(ctx) => {
  return redirect("/dashboard", {
    state: [FlashMessage({ text: "Item saved!" })],
  });
};
```

Or via `ctx.setLocationState()` on any response:

```tsx
(ctx) => {
  ctx.setLocationState(FlashMessage({ text: "Welcome back!" }));
  return <Dashboard />;
};
```

### .read() (non-hook access)

Read current location state outside React components (client-side only):

```tsx
import { FlashMessage, ProductState } from "../location-states";

// Returns TState | undefined. Returns undefined during SSR.
const flash = FlashMessage.read();
const product = ProductState.read();
```

> **Hydration:** `.read()` returns `undefined` on the server but may return
> a real value on the first client render (history state survives reload).
> Do not call `.read()` directly during the initial render of a component;
> call it from an event handler or inside a `useEffect` post-mount. For
> reactive hydration-safe access, use `useLocationState()` instead.

### .write() / .delete() (static, non-reactive)

Static counterparts to `.read()`. Both mutate the current history entry's
`history.state` via `replaceState`, preserving any other keys (router
bookkeeping, other location state slots). Both are client-only; they throw
when called on the server.

Neither dispatches an event, so components reading via `useLocationState`
will NOT re-render until the next navigation/popstate. Pair with `.read()`
(or a fresh mount via back/forward/reload) instead.

```tsx
"use client";
import { ProductState } from "./state";

// Persisted across hard refresh and back/forward of this entry.
ProductState.write({ name: "Widget", price: 9.99 });

// Read later (or on next mount).
const current = ProductState.read();

// Manually clear the slot. Idempotent if it isn't set.
ProductState.delete();
```

| Method      | Updates `history.state` | Fires `useLocationState` rerender | SSR behavior        |
| ----------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| `.read()`   | no                      | n/a (returns snapshot)            | returns `undefined` |
| `.write()`  | yes (replace this slot) | no                                | throws              |
| `.delete()` | yes (remove this slot)  | no                                | throws              |

## Cache Control

### invalidateClientCache()

Force the client's caches to miss after a mutation the router can't see (a REST
call, a WebSocket push, a login). It is a plain function, not a hook, so it works
from module-level callbacks too. Imported from the root entry `@rangojs/router`,
it is selected by export conditions: in a client component it marks the caches
stale immediately; from a handler/server component it writes a rotated
`Set-Cookie` for the responding client.

```tsx
"use client";
import { invalidateClientCache } from "@rangojs/router";

function SaveButton() {
  const handleSave = async () => {
    await fetch("/api/data", {
      method: "POST",
      body: JSON.stringify(data),
    });

    // Invalidate the client's caches after the mutation
    invalidateClientCache();
  };

  return <button onClick={handleSave}>Save</button>;
}
```

A module-level subscription works the same way (no component needed):

```ts
import { invalidateClientCache } from "@rangojs/router";

socket.on("catalog-updated", () => invalidateClientCache());
```

**Use cases**: REST API mutations, WebSocket updates, non-RSC data changes.
